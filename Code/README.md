There are two folders with this file. One is for RIS model and the other is for Oxydation model.

## 1. Packages
This code is written in Python 3, be sure to have a compatible platform or IDE to run this code. Before running, we need install some extra packages.
numpy
scipy
matplotlib

## 2. RIS
The code of RIS imite a Fortran version. You can check find all original codes in the folder called 'MIK' in the folder 'RIS'.
Folder 'images' contains some figures of results
Folder 'MIK' constains all Fortran code about MIK
Folder 'sensibility' contains all files which are used for sensibility of parameters
Folder 'test' constains some test data generated by Fortran code
File 'Default.csv' and 'TNES_304.csv' represent initial profile of Cr
File 'RIS_MIK.py' is for MIK model
File 'RIS_app.py' contains some application with MIK
File 'RIS_GiMIK.py' is a ameliorated MIK
File 'RIS_sen.py' is for sensibility of MIK
File 'RIS_test.py' is to test MIK

## 3. Corrosion
This code imite a C version.
Folder 'Inputs' conatins 8 input data files
Folder 'Outputs' conatins all output data file
Folder 'Oxydation' contains all C code of corrosion model
Forder 'refs' contains 8 test data file generated by C code
File 'oxydation.py' is for oxydation model
File 'oxydation_app.py' contains some application with oxydation model
File 'oxydation_test.py' is to test oxydation model

## 4. Couple
In the same subfolder as RIS and Corrosion, we have supplied a couplage model called 'COUPLAGE.py' which combines RIS and Corrosion.
